    My name is Kevin Hudgens and I am a self taught software engineer. 
    This is my first Django project without a tutorial.
    <br>
    This project is web application that functions as a contact book.

    <strong>Lessons Learned:</strong> 
</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Django</strong></li>
    <p>
        I can confidently say I can set up a Django project and create apps for 
        it. Still need to familiarize myself with everything Django is capable 
        of but I can definitely work with it.
    </p>
    <li><strong>Object Oriented Programming</strong></li>
    <p>
        Being forced to work with classes for the models.py, definitely helped 
        me see the use of classes and decide on how to better use them.
    </p>
</ul>

<p>
    <strong>Challenges:</strong> 
</p>
<ul>
    <li> <strong>Templates:</strong>  </li>
        <p>
            For my first time working with Django templates, it was a little 
            tricky.
        </p>
    <li><strong>URL Patterns:</strong></li>
        <p>
            When trying to decide whether the patterns go in the project folder 
            or the individual urls.py folder, is when I met the wall.
        </p>
    <li><strong>Loading BootStrap:</strong></li>
        <p>
            Trying to work with multiple css folders for my bootstrap themes was
            a good experience.
        </p>
